Software Vulnerability Fundamentals
-----------------------------------

Process of attacking a vulnerability in a program is called _exploiting_ .

_Auditing and Black Box Testing_

Both forms uncover vulnerabilities -

Auditing: Mainly based on the analysis of application code.

Black box testing: Manipulation of exposed interfaces// generation of crafted inputs.

_SDLC_ System Development Lyfe Cycle

_Vulnerability Classes_

* Design = High level(problems with program requirements or constraints)
* Implementation = technical flaws
* Operational = Not present in the source code - "rooted in how software interacts with its environment"(16).

_Common Threads_

* Buffer Overflow: When a program attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold. 
* Input and interfaces
* Environmental: Attacking program's runtime environment.

### Adittional on operating system

* UNIX operating system composed of
1. the kernel: Hub of the operating system
2. the shell: interface & command line interpreter _CLI_
3. the programs
