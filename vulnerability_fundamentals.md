Software Vulnerability Fundamentals & Design Review
-----------------------------------

Process of attacking a vulnerability in a program is called _exploiting_ .

_Auditing and Black Box Testing_

Both forms uncover vulnerabilities -

Auditing: Mainly based on the analysis of application code.

Black box testing: Manipulation of exposed interfaces// generation of crafted inputs.

_SDLC_ System Development Lyfe Cycle

_Vulnerability Classes 

* Design = High level(problems with program requirements or constraints)
* Implementation = technical flaws
* Operational = Not present in the source code - "rooted in how software interacts with its environment"(16).

_Common Threads_

* Buffer Overflow: When a program attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold. 
* Input and interfaces
* Environmental: Attacking program's runtime environment.

### Adittional on operating system

* UNIX operating system composed of
1. the kernel: Hub of the operating system
2. the shell: interface & command line interpreter _CLI_
3. the programs

#### Design Review 

- A major component of software design is the security expectations associated with system's users and resources.

### Abstraction and Decomposition

  - Abstraction is the process of generalization, this leaves only the most important parts and removes details. In software it highlights processes, concepts and systems
  - Decomposition: Can be approached in a top-down (large into small) or bottom-up hierarchy(generalization) type.The last is about similarities in components and developing high abstractions.

### Trust relationships

 - It is important that systems established trust boundaries (permissions for read, write , and execute). In every trust boundary, there is one absolute authority.
 - Chain of trust: It implies that it is a "viable security construct" Trust needs to be audited in deep to see the access given within the chain of trust.
  However if using libraries there is no room to limit the exposure of systems and components ... that is an easy exploit right there.

  ## Core principles in software design

  - Loose coupling: Communication between modules-Loose implies exchange of data through public interfaces. Strongly expose elements within internal interfaces.
